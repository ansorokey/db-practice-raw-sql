## Data Storage
Why exactly are databases a 2d matrix?
Imagine a folder on your computer.
In that folder, we organized a bunch of pictures of landmarks. Each folder is a country, and within each folder is the pictures taken in those countries.
Right now, the data is stored in a heiracry based on location and location alone.

There is no simple way to change this, If - for example - we wanted to re-organize the folders by the photographer, or by the date. There isnt a single button to press that will make new folders and redistribute the photos into the correct locations.

The reason databases are 2d matrix spreadsheet style is because we can readily see all the info about data at a glance, and the parameters that define it as columns.
The columns allow us to sort and sift through data without having to restructue anything, since they're just detailed lists; lists we can remove or add data on to when looking though them.
